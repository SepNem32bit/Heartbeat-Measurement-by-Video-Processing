# Heartbeat-Measurement-by-Video-Processing
Heartbeat was used to be measured by various devices in the past, but new technologies enable us to measure that by color analysis of a video. In this case study report, we will go through an algorithm of heartbeat measurement using video that was presented by Markus van Almsick in Wolfram Website. We will devise different scenarios based on two skin classifiers and two color systems to assess the accuracy of this algorithm in different conditions. <br />
Due to the size of code and its format (Mathematica Wolfram), I can't upload it on GitHub.
